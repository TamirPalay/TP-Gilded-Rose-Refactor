## Test-first process

I followed a test-first (characterization) approach to lock existing behavior
before refactoring or adding new features.

Tests were added in the following order:

1. **Normal item degradation**
   - Verifies that sellIn and quality decrease by 1 for a standard item.

2. **Normal item after sell date**
   - Verifies that quality degrades twice as fast once the sell date has passed.




# Gilded Rose starting position in Java

## Run the TextTest Fixture from Command-Line

```
./gradlew -q text
```

### Specify Number of Days

For e.g. 10 days:

```
./gradlew -q text --args 10
```

You should make sure the gradle commands shown above work when you execute them in a terminal before trying to use TextTest (see below).


## Run the TextTest approval test that comes with this project

There are instructions in the [TextTest Readme](../texttests/README.md) for setting up TextTest. What's unusual for the Java version is there are two executables listed in [config.gr](../texttests/config.gr) for Java. The first uses Gradle wrapped in a python script. Uncomment these lines to use it:

    executable:${TEXTTEST_HOME}/Java/texttest_rig.py
    interpreter:python

The other relies on your CLASSPATH being set correctly in [environment.gr](../texttests/environment.gr). Uncomment these lines to use it instead:

    executable:com.gildedrose.TexttestFixture
    interpreter:java
